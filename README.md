I have been integrating my series of research projects, which collectively focus on one of the most exciting topics right now, across all different disciplines: the use of Machine Learning (ML). 

In my research, I examine the applications of ML to finance and, more generally, business. One key theme in ML is to use advanced statistical techniques and computational power to identify trends in large datasets. This applies to everything from deciding whether a bank customer should be approved for a new loan, identifying new products for an insurance company client, or even recommending a new movie to viewers!

My work starts with the statistical foundations (including a review of basic regression models) of ML and then proceeds to differentiating between supervised and unsupervised learning models. My research covers topics including classification and regression trees (CART), other tree-based models (random forests, AdaBoost/XGBoost), support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), neural networks, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, I address important qualitative issues in ML such as interpretability/explainability, model validation, ethics in AI/ML, and addressing biases in algorithms.

This series of studies provides a comprehensive overview of the current applications and challenges in the field of Machine Learning.
